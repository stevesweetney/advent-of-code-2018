# Advent of Code 2018

This year marks my first time participating in AoC

I'll be writing my solutions in Rust with the help of the [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) helper. As I go I'll try to make solutions more efficient

Run

```
cargo aoc -d $day
```
to get solutions for any given day
